      <p>Hi, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Jonathan Pham and I am 21 years of age and currently reside in Tallahasse, Florida. My hobbies are caring for my furry son Oreo; cooking, working out, and hanging out with my family and friends. I'm also really into cars and my favorite brands are BMW, Mercedes, and Ferrari.</p>

      <p>I have a saying "1% better everyday in anyway" I believe that any progress is good progress. When you're tackling on something new; it's difficult to get a hang of in the beginning but, with consistency you're capable of mastering the skill to the highest level.</p>

      <p>With that being said, I thank you again for coming onto my website and if you have any questions, feel free to connect with me by clicking on the contact page above!</p>
